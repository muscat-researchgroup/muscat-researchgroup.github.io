With the continuous development of large scale software systems, different forms of requirements must be related, in a consistent way, to other activities and artifacts of the development and operational life cycle (dev+ops). We study in this project the improvement of practices in software and Machine Learning (ML) engineering. We propose sound techniques to choose the best ML workflows when contradictions appear (in time series), and to organize these workflows in portofolios. We also study the elicitation and automatic production of requirements justification in software-based experiments and devops contexts.


### Ongoing and recent projects:

  - Reusing experiments and capitalizing knowledge in jupyter notebooks
  - Mastering anomalies in machine learning workflow (anomaly detection in time series): what are the requirements that drive the choice of the best workflow? How to learn from apparent contradictions?
  - Machine learning workflows portfolio: problem identification through software product lines techniques and meta-learning approaches: http://rockflows.i3s.unice.fr/
  - Justification Factory: from justification requirements elicitation to their continuous production
